# IllinoiStudent

## Purpose

II'll start the hack by proposing a general and graphical idea of how would I made the app to be a help for students. This, with a wirefrime by hand (helps to my creativity) and a description of how would it work. To this I did some search of Chicago places and some places near to the Illinois University. Based on the requirements of the challengem this is my general idea to solve the problem. So, please take a look to the images at the Wireframe folder. Each component has a number, which is described next.
